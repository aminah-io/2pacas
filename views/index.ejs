  <h2>Features</h2>
  <h3>Easy to use.</h3>
  <p>This app is so easy to use, we've even trained some of our past alpaca clients to be able to use the app on their own, without their human!</p>

  <h3>Huge selection of alpaca singles.</h3>
  <p>While the app is new, our company has been around for decades, so we have the most up-to-date database of alpaca singles, and hundreds more being vetted everyday! Not that they need to be vetted; we've never met an alpaca we didn't like :wink-wink:</p>

  <h3>Love guaranteed.</h3>
  <p>We find your alpaca love, or your money back. Our alpacas have never had to go on dates with more than three alpaca singles to be able to find their one true alpaca love. We know yours will be lucky lucky!</p>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>It was about 35 years ago that our family alpaca, Rotini, almost died of loneliness. We thought he'd caught some kind of rare alpaca disease, and he truly did: the disease of a broken heart.</p>
  <p>There was a lovely alpaca lady by the name of Gloria who'd been living next door to us the past 4 years. Rotini and Gloria were inseparable--they ate together, played together, and enjoyed long walks around the valley together.</p>
  <p>But one day, Gloria's humans decided to sell her in exchange for miniature ponies. That was the beginning of Rotini's demise. He stopped eating, he stopped drinking, he stopped playing. We introduced him to Connect, one of the ponies, but Rotini was completely uninterested.</p>
  <p>That's when we started asking around for available alpacas to give Rotini some companionship.We met a family with a whole boatload of alpacas, most of them male, but they had two ladies. One of them, Priscilla, was around Rotini's age, so we brought them to a nearby park to play.</p>
  <p>At first, Rotini was really shy, but about an hour into their date, he warmed up to Priscilla, and they played like they'd never played before!</p>
  <p>Our Rotini was back to his old self within a week! That's when we realized that we could help other lonely alpacas out there by providing a dating & mating service. We've been helping bring together lovely alpacas since then.</p>
  <p>And now, we're excited to bring the ease of mating your alpacas to the palm of your human (and alpaca) hand!</p>
