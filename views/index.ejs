  <h2 class="about-heading d-flex justify-content-center text-center pt-4">About</h2>
  <div class="about px-5 mt-5">
    <p class="fw-light">It was about 35 years ago that our family alpaca, Rotini, almost died of loneliness. We thought he'd caught some kind of rare alpaca disease, and he truly did: the disease of a broken heart.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">There was a lovely alpaca lady by the name of Gloria who'd been living next door to us the past 4 years. Rotini and Gloria were inseparable--they ate together, played together, and enjoyed long walks around the valley together.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">But one day, Gloria's humans decided to sell her in exchange for miniature ponies. That was the beginning of Rotini's demise. He stopped eating, he stopped drinking, he stopped playing. We introduced him to Connect, one of the ponies, but Rotini was completely uninterested.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">That's when we started asking around for available alpacas to give Rotini some companionship. We met a family with a whole boatload of alpacas, most of them male, but they did had two ladies. One of them, Priscilla, was around Rotini's age, so we brought them to a nearby park to play.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">At first, Rotini was really shy, but about an hour into their date, he warmed up to Priscilla, and they played like they'd never played before!</p>
    <p class="fw-light">Our Rotini was back to his old self within a week! That's when we realized that we could help other lonely alpacas out there by providing a dating & mating service. We've been helping bring together lovely alpacas ever since.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">And now, we're excited to bring the ease of mating your alpacas to the palm of your human (and alpaca) hand!</p>
